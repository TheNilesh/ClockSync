About
=====

Distributed systems starts multiple processes on different sites, all of them works in parallel.
These processes works together to perform a task. They must be synchronised. The synchronisation simulation using Lamports logical clock synchronisation algorithm.

Usage
=====
Each instance of ```Bully``` corresponds to a Process in distributed system. Multiple instance can communicate using controls provided in GUI.
